    "# Assignment #1: Evaluate Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "In your first graded assignment for this course, you will find and evaluate a data set on a topic of your choosing. You will be given specific questions related to the data set, and you will also be tasked with importing the data from your data set into your Jupyter Notebook environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Choose a Broad Topic\n",
    "\n",
    "First, choose a topic of interest to you, such as a specific social issue, a political or cultural trend, a community, or a hobby or personal interest. Ideally, it should be something relatively broad that society or culture is having some sort of conversation about, or which many people think about on a regular basis. Possible examples might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Housing and rental prices in New York City\n",
    "- A popular genre of music\n",
    "- A sport\n",
    "- Food prices\n",
    "- Crime\n",
    "- Government spending\n",
    "- Popularity of movies or TV shows \n",
    "- Bestselling books\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find a Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for terms related to your topic on Google, both generally and by adding specific names of websites where data will commonly be found. The following websites are frequently places to find data sets, and it sometimes makes sense to both search directly on the site and to do regular Google searches with the site name:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Google Data Set Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n",
    "- [GitHub](https://github.com/)\n",
    "- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)\n",
    "- [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if your topic is bestselling books, you might try these searches on Google:\n",
    "\n",
    "- bestselling books data set\n",
    "- bestselling books data set kaggle\n",
    "- bestselling books data set github\n",
    "- bestselling books data set \n",
    "\n",
    "You're not likely to find bestselling books data on data.gov, but you might find a lot of info related to health, the economy, and demographics, since that's what the government is most concerned about."
